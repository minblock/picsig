Put these two files..

	*  libcurl.dll	(up in the main uTu folder)
	*  libcurl.lib

inside your "lib" folder (inside the main bloodshed folder)

and drop the "curl" folder (with all the curl headers.h) into
your "includes" folder.

I have put them inside folders of the same name, added help!

now you have..

...\lib\libcurl.dll		(you definitely need this)
...\lib\libcurl.lib		(i think you need this)

and..

...\include\curl\curl.h
...\include\curl\curlver.h
etc.

that's all you need, the headers, and the two library files.
now whenever you need curl functions in your application, do..

#include <curl/curl.h>

at the top of your program, and away you go! remember you'll need
to include a copy of libcurl.dll with your application! it's best
also copied into your/their PATH somewhere, so your compiled apps
can find it, or else leave a copy next to the application.

I definitely recommend you download the full source package..

	http://curl.haxx.se/download.html	(over one million downloads!)

you can keep the headers and libs elsewhere if you pass these
parameters to your compiler, but it makes sense to keep them in your
regular tree, these are real handy functions to have around!

note: to compile your apps, you may have to pass extra arguments onto
the compiler command, here's my current (probably over-the-top) command..

$(FilePath) -o $(FileNameNoExt).exe  -I"C:\unix\bin\gcc\include"  -I"C:\unix\bin\cpp\include\curl"  -I"C:\unix\bin\cpp\include"  -I"include"   -L"C:\unix\bin\gcc\lib" -L"C:\unix\bin\cpp\lib" -L"lib" -lcurl -lwsock32 -lws2_32 -lwinmm

the format is an EditPlus "tool" (feel free to use it!), but the part
after the .exe bit might be useful to you, especially the switches at
the end.

goan, make big fun now!
