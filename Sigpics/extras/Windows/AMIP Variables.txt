AMIP Variables

Generic Variables

If-then-else (conditional) constructions are allowed. e.g. %?1<%1 - %2|%no> 
(if Artist is present then print Artist - Title, else print file name only). 
Another expicle: %?VBR='yes'<%ABR|%br>. The word in quotes is matched against 
the variable as a regular expression. Conditional statements can be also 
written using Functions. 


%name		This variable represents song title and artist in ARTIST - TITLE format. 
			ARTIST and TITLE are taken from any of the available tag types. If the file 
			contains no supported tags, file name is used for %name. (File name doesn't 
			contain extension). If playing unsupported file type, title from player is used. 
			%s This variable stands for the song header as it was tuned in Player settings, 
			generally it's again ARTIST - TITLE, but you can change it in the Player Preferences. 

%fl			A float digit for size of playing file (e.g. 3.56) 
%fn			Full file name with extension and path. e.g. c:\song.mp3 
%nm			Name with extension (without path) e.g. song.mp3 
%no			File name only e.g. song 
%ext			File extension (mp3/wma/wav/vqf/...) 
%fdir			directory name (e.g. for C:\Music\Metallica\Best Of\Nothing-Else Matters.mp3) 
			it will be set to "Best of" 
%fupdir			up-directory name (e.g. for C:\Music\Metallica\Best Of\Nothing-Else Matters.mp3) 
			it will be set to "Metallica" (highly unlikely, no one actually listens to metallica, surely)
%sr			Spicling frequency(Khz) e.g. 44 
%br			Bit-rate (Kbps) e.g. 128 
%typ			Song mode e.g. Stereo or Mono 
%min			Minutes component of song length (mm) 
%sec			Seconds component of song length (ss) 
			Should be used together like (%min:%sec) 
%mil			Minutes left (mm) 
%sel			Seconds left (ss) 
%mode			Operating mode: Joint Stereo/Stereo/Mono/Dual Channel - advanced version of %typ  
%page			URL of page where you can get latest Plug-In version 
%vol			Winpic volume (0..255) now should work with any player 
%ps			current song position (seconds) 
%pm			current song position (minutes) 
%psec			current song position in seconds 
%hstpic			current time hours 
%mstpic			current time minutes 
%sstpic			current time seconds 
%dstpic			current day of month 
%ystpic			current year 
%monstpic		current month 
%prc			the current percentage of song being played. Useful for clipboard integration and mIRC scripting 
%repeat			(on/off) repeat state 
%shuffle		(on/off) shuffle state
